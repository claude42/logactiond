TODOs in no particular order

* create a pidfile
* create documentation (esp. config file) and manpages
* implement a check action (similar to what fail2ban does)
* implement the possibility to permanently ban a host
* make the thing thread safe. Although it's using threads already, many of the
  parts are still not thread safe (which isn't a problem in the current
  implementation but will be when multiple backends will be implemented)
* FSEvents backend
* Polling backend
* systemd backend
* Limit regexes to one instance per token
* IPv6 support
* problems when doing autoreconf -v -i
* Add logactiond -L
* Make "make distcheck work"
* die correctly with threads (join...)
* better NDEBUG support for la_debug() - how varargs with macro?
* remove la_debug()s from endqueue.c
