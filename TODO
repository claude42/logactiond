TODOs in no particular order

* make the thing thread safe. Although it's using threads already, many of the
  parts are still not thread safe (which isn't a problem in the current
  implementation but will be when multiple backends will be implemented)
* Limit regexes to one instance per token
* Add logactiond -L
* die correctly with threads (join...)
* error message if log file is lost for longer time
* check for root / add option to run as non-root
* better NDEBUG support for la_debug() - how varargs with macro?
* Debian package
---
* get rid of create_property_from_action_token()
* ACX_PTHREAD?! outdated? works on MacOS?
* Status files in correct loation? (/var/run)
* find_end_command with address==NULL alsays returns NULL but
  trigger_single_command expects otherwise
* can create_command with address==NULL happen?
* is code right to expect that command->address is never NULL?
