TODOs in no particular order

* Limit regexes to one instance per token
* error message if log file is lost for longer time
* better NDEBUG support for la_debug() - how varargs with macro?
* Debian package
---
* find_end_command with address==NULL alsays returns NULL but
  trigger_single_command expects otherwise
* can create_command with address==NULL happen?
* is code right to expect that command->address is never NULL?
* use sd_journal_send
* local macros in m4 directory (https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/automake/manual/automake.html#Local-Macros)
* does not shutdown correctly on a crash or when an assert() fails
  pthread_cancel(pthread_self()) doesn't invoke cleanup action
* improve ITERATE macros
* add assert()s everywhere :-)
* don't initially wait 5s in dump loop

* General: frequently does not shut down correctly on error, e.g. doesn't
  remove fifo. More specifically: is die_err() etc. allowed in cleanup actions?
* fifo should probably lock queue mutex right from the start

* simple syntax error in config file on reload leads to crash, eg.:
<3>logactiond.cfg:33 - syntax error!
<3>inotify.c:157: find_source_by_file_wd: Assertion 'list' failed.
<3>watch.c:158: shutdown_watching: Assertion 'list' failed.
<6>Host: 211.35.76.241, action "route" ended for rule "sshd".
<3>watch.c:158: shutdown_watching: Assertion 'list' failed.
<3>watch.c:158: shutdown_watching: Assertion 'list' failed.

* Wildcards for log files

* ist die Reihenfolge rule/uc_rule richtig bei remote bzw. meta_enabled - oder
  m√ºsste es genau andersrum sein?

* Send startup errors to standard out instead of syslog - really??

"dontroute" rule configuration directive so it doesn't get send to other
servers

* make sure remote configuration gets properly updated on reload as well

* don't activate crypto (and messaging) stuff in case libsodium is not
  available

* copy state file instead of renaming it
