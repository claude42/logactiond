TODOs in no particular order

* make the thing thread safe. Although it's using threads already, many of the
  parts are still not thread safe (which isn't a problem in the current
  implementation but will be when multiple backends will be implemented)
* Limit regexes to one instance per token
* Add logactiond -L
* Make "make distcheck work"
* die correctly with threads (join...)
* error message if log file is lost for longer time
* check for root / add option to run as non-root
* create_command - switch back from addr to host
